thers lots of things can be improve
1. improve the color quality it kind of very shaded 
...its look very old kind of stuff,dosn't attract an eye

2.some places images are overflown to the box container , neeened to be fix that.
3.  decrease the size of image as it is neended in some places
4. needed to be less scrobellable page like we have to section the page. people these day prefer small view page where they can get 
all required field.
5. there is no patteren in spacing between element as there is so much wastage of space . elements are put in hazardus manner .
this whole page needed to be degin in moder way/moder patteren
